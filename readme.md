# Usage

### Example command

```cs
[Command("pause")]
[RequireLavaPlayerState(LavaPlayerState.UserAndBotInSameChannel | LavaPlayerState.Playing)]
public async Task PauseCommand()
{  
    // this code will only runs if the bot is in the same channel as the user and if the lava player is playing some music

    LavaPlayer player = lavaNode.GetPlayer(Context.Guild);
    await player.PauseAsync();
}
```

### Work with precondition returns
In order to get the return message from the precondition, you have to list for the `CommandExecuted` event.  
Add this in your command handler. Read more [here](https://discord.foxbot.me/docs/guides/commands/post-execution.html).
```cs
public async Task OnCommandExecutedAsync(Optional<CommandInfo> command, ICommandContext context, IResult result)
{
    // result contains the message
    switch(result)
    {
        case VictoriaPreconditionResult victoriaResult:
            // do something extra with it
            break;

        default:
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(result.ErrorReason))
            {
                await context.Channel.SendMessageAsync(result.ErrorReason);
            }
            break;
    }
}
```
